# StarBot
A moderation discord bot that I made to improve my own server, and add personalisation

2. If using npm, run `npm install [packages]` in your command line, or if you prefer to use yarn, run `yarn add [packages]`
3. Copy the .env.example file and rename the copy to .env, and input the required details from your [Reddit APP](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
